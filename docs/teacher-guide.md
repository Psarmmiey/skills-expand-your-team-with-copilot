# Teacher's Guide to Requesting Changes

This guide explains how to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities website without needing to modify code yourself.

Instead of editing the code directly, you can create an **issue** on GitHub using our pre-made forms. These forms will guide you through providing all the information needed for changes to be made automatically.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in this GitHub repository
2. **Click the "New Issue" button**
3. **Choose the appropriate template** for what you need
4. **Fill out the form** with the requested information
5. **Click "Submit new issue"**

That's it! Your request will be reviewed and implemented.

## Tips for Good Requests

### ✅ Do:
- Be specific and detailed
- Explain why the change is needed
- Provide examples when possible
- Include any relevant information about timing or urgency

### ❌ Don't:
- Leave required fields blank
- Use technical jargon or programming terms
- Submit multiple unrelated requests in one issue
- Expect instant implementation (changes need to be reviewed and tested)

## What Happens After You Submit?

1. Your request will be reviewed
2. If more information is needed, someone will ask questions in the issue
3. Once approved, the changes will be implemented
4. You'll be notified when the changes are complete
5. You can test the changes and provide feedback

## Questions or Problems?

If you're not sure which template to use or need help:
- Leave a comment on the issue
- Contact the repository administrator
- Check the [Development Guide](how-to-develop.md) for technical details

**Remember:** These templates are designed to make requesting changes easy! You don't need any programming knowledge - just fill out the forms as completely as possible.
